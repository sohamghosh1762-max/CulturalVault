It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal is regarded as one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture, a style that combines elements from Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Indian architectural styles. In 1983, the Taj Mahal became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is considered one of the greatest works of architecture in the world and has been called 'the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.'",

Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Later on, many successive dynasties have built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). The wall stretches from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, along an arc that roughly delineates the southern edge of Inner Mongolia.",

Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms, and improvisation. As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime, and blues.",

Batik is made either by drawing dots and lines of the resist with a spouted tool called a canting, or by printing the resist with a copper stamp called a cap. The applied wax resists dyes and therefore allows the artisan to color selectively by soaking the cloth in one color, removing the wax with boiling water, and repeating if multiple colors are desired. A cloth that is decorated using this technique is also called batik. UNESCO inscribed Indonesian batik on the Intangible Cultural Heritage list in October 2009.",

The haiku emerged from the hokku, the opening verse of a longer collaborative poem form known as haikai no renga. Although Matsuo Bashō (1644–1694), Yosa Buson (1716–1784), Kobayashi Issa (1763–1828) and Masaoka Shiki (1867–1902) are often considered the four haiku masters, there are many other haiku poets who have contributed to this literary form.",

Contemporary Aboriginal art developed in the 1970s as a bridge between traditional culture and the modern world. The dot painting technique was introduced in 1971 when Geoffrey Bardon encouraged the Papunya elders to paint their Dreaming stories on canvas instead of the ground. The dots served to disguise the sacred symbolism beneath, making it more appropriate to share with outsiders. Today, Aboriginal art is one of Australia's most recognized cultural exports and continues to tell stories of Dreamtime, Country, and ancestral connections.",

The Silk Road derived its name from the lucrative trade in silk carried out along its length, beginning in the Han dynasty in China (207 BCE–220 CE). These trade routes are also responsible for spreading the plague across Eurasia and have been credited with facilitating the spread of Christianity and Islam.",

The epic is considered a fundamental text of the Western canon.",
