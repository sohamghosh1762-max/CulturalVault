## ✨ Features

### 🏛️ Core Platform & Exploration
*   **Responsive Heritage Grid** — Staggered, grid-based card layout showcasing cultural monuments, artifacts, and literature with mobile-first responsiveness.
*   **Interactive Geolocation Map** — Powered by Leaflet/React-Leaflet, highlighting cultural assets and endangered heritage zones geographically.
*   **Debounced Smart Search** — Instantly query terms across titles, descriptions, and tags with a optimized 350ms debounce layer.
*   **Multi-Category Filtering** — Switch seamlessly between 8 custom cultural disciplines (*Architecture, Art, Music, Literature, Cuisine, Traditions, Crafts, and Dance*) using animated pill buttons.
*   **Dynamic Sorting & Pagination** — Sort artifacts alphabetically, by highest rating, newest discovery, or oldest origin, backed by paginated layouts.
*   **Bookmarks System** — Save favorite heritage files directly to personal collections via a custom React Context + LocalStorage wrapper.

### 👤 Personalized User Dashboard & Accounts
*   **Gmail Authentication Flow** — Fast local sign-in and sign-up flows tracking accounts with session tokens.
*   **Personal Profile Controls** — Interactive user profiles enabling real-time name edits, customizable email addresses, and an interactive interest selector.
*   **Profile Avatar Management** — Interactive profile picture change capability saving avatar base64 strings locally.
*   **Account Age Tracker** — Displays relative dates for account duration (e.g. *Active for 3 days*, *Joined yesterday*).
*   **Interest-Based Content Recommendations** — Displays custom recommended oral stories, articles, and artifacts prioritized based on selected active interest categories.

### 🕒 Recently Viewed History
*   **Interactive Session Logger** — Automatically logs user view history for Stories, Articles, Community posts, and Risk events.
*   **Real-time Type Filter** — A premium dropdown filter (**All Views**, **Blogs & Articles**, **Stories**, **Community Heritage**, and **Risk Dashboard**) next to the history header.
*   **Dynamic Empty States** — Informative dashed-border placeholders indicating missing history categories dynamically.

### 🛡️ Risk Intelligence & Management
*   **Risk Dashboard Map** — Interactive map detailing endangered cultural monuments facing climate, environmental, or conflict threats.
*   **Real-time Risk Metrics** — View localized vulnerability indicators and risk reports.

### 🎙️ Oral Stories & Archive
*   **Audio Playbacks** — Native audio player integration for listening to recorded oral folklore from regional narrators.
*   **Multimedia Story Galleries** — Displays high-resolution photographic slides matching each storytelling item.

### 🤖 AI Cultural Companion (Advanced AI-Based Capabilities)
*   **Real-time Streaming Engine** — Integrates Vercel's AI SDK stream pipelines mapping to the high-speed **Gemini 2.5 Flash** model for smooth, sub-second latency markdown responses.
*   **Multimodal Visual Recognition** — Native file upload attachments parsed on-the-fly via a client-side `FileReader` base64 converter. Users can upload images of monuments, scripts, or relics and ask the AI model to explain their historical significance.
*   **Voice Input Dictation (Speech-to-Text)** — Custom dictation triggers using the browser's web Speech Recognition API to translate user spoken word queries into text inputs in real time.
*   **Multi-Language Translators** — A select dropdown dynamically instructing the LLM to process and output responses entirely in the user's preferred language (**English, Spanish, Hindi, Bengali, French, or Arabic**), syncing voice capture language configurations to match.
*   **Session State Cache** — Session logs are cached locally on client devices (`cultural_vault_chat_<id>`) and indexed inside sidebars, letting users manage, load, or delete separate conversations.
*   **Reasoning & Citations Pipeline** — Direct visual indicators (`<Reasoning>` and `<Sources>`) extracting source citations and logical deduction steps returned by the model stream.

### 📊 Admin Control Center
*   **Operational Analytics** — System telemetry dashboards reporting items explored, active collections, and curator rankings.
*   **Content Moderation & Security Logs** — Panel displaying database size, contribution metrics, and security checkpoints.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Architecture

### 🖥️ Frontend (Client Side)
*   **Core Framework**: [Next.js 16(App Router)](https://nextjs.org/) for single-page dynamic routing, layout nesting, and high-performance client views.
*   **Library**: [React 18](https://react.dev/) using advanced hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`) for interactive, responsive components.
*   **Language**: [TypeScript 5](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for complete build-time type safety across data contracts, components, and service layers.
*   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS 3](https://tailwindcss.com/) utilizing absolute themes, custom ambient orange/amber palettes, and premium glassmorphism layouts (`backdrop-blur-md`).
*   **Animations**: [Framer Motion 11](https://www.framer.com/motion/) providing page load transitions, card entry lists, and responsive hover micro-interactions.
*   **Map Integrations**: [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.org/) & [React Leaflet 4](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) for loading and plotting geo-coordinates of heritage danger spots and folklore narrations.
*   **State Store**: [Zustand 4](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for low-overhead client state transitions.
*   **Theme Control**: [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) backing light-to-dark automated toggle sequences.
*   **Visual Analytics**: [Recharts 3](https://recharts.org/) rendering administrative status metrics, activity trackers, and data histograms.
*   **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) vectors.

### ⚙️ Backend (Server Side & Database)
*   **Serverless APIs**: Next.js API Routes supporting advanced queries (e.g. search, pagination, category filtering, and sorting parameters).
*   **Database Schema (ODM)**: [Mongoose 9](https://mongoosejs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) managing metadata, upload telemetry, and administrative logs.
*   **Storage Synchronization Layer**: Client-side `localStorage` cache supporting profile persistence, bookmarks, user interest scopes, and recently viewed filtering history directly in the browser session.

### 🤖 AI Model & Integration
*   **Underlying Model**: **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash / Pro** models, delivering lightning-fast, highly accurate context processing for heritage exploration, safety recommendations, and narrative transcriptions.
*   **Integration Layer**: [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) (`ai` and `@ai-sdk/google` provider) powering continuous streaming responses (`useChat`), structural JSON generation, and smooth rendering text outputs.

### 📊 Overall Details & Data Flow
1.  **Exploration & Search Queries**: Component-based queries execute requests through centralized hooks (`useItems`) which fetch from Next.js serverless routes. Text filters are debounced by 350ms on the client.
2.  **View Logging & Filtering**: Whenever details pages load, a helper function records page actions to a `recently_viewed_history` array stored in local memory. The dashboard UI fetches this dataset and filters entries according to dropdown preferences.
3.  **Recommendations Engine**: A client-side interest mapper reads selected tags (e.g. *Art, Cuisine, Traditions*) from the active user's profile context and sorts standard database rows to match primary user tags.
4.  **Admin Telemetry**: The Admin Dashboard integrates system telemetry indicators checking database size metrics, contribution tallies, and security access logs visualized through Recharts.
